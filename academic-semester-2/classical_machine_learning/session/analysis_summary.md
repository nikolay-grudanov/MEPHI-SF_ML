# Analysis Summary and Recommendations

## Dataset Analysis
- The dataset contains 23,479 signals with 500 time points each
- 9 signals hit the maximum value (14834), indicating detector saturation
- 22,923 signals have multiple peaks (this number seems unusually high and should be verified)
- The data represents time-series signals from a detector

## Data Preprocessing
The current preprocessing steps are appropriate:
1. Removing metadata columns
2. Inverting the signal and adjusting the baseline
3. Calculating maximum value, amplitude, and area under the curve
4. Standardizing the features for clustering

## Feature Engineering
Current features:
1. `max`: Maximum value in each signal
2. `amplitude`: Difference between max and min values
3. `square`: Sum of all values (proxy for area under the curve)

Recommendations:
- Consider adding more time-domain features like rise time, fall time, pulse width
- Consider adding frequency-domain features using FFT
- The current definition of "multiple peaks" (height=100, distance=100) might be too sensitive, causing 98% of signals to be classified as multi-peak

## Clustering Analysis
Several methods were compared:
1. KMeans: Silhouette score 0.7467
2. Agglomerative: Silhouette score 0.7509
3. DBSCAN: Best score 0.7935 (eps=0.3, min_samples=3)
4. Gaussian Mixture: Silhouette score 0.5450

Recommendations:
- DBSCAN with eps=0.3 and min_samples=3 performs best
- The manual thresholding approach (-0.015 on PCA component 2) works well but is less generalizable
- Consider ensemble methods combining multiple clustering approaches

## Special Cases
- Saturated signals (max value = 14834) are correctly identified and handled separately
- Multi-peak signals are identified but the current threshold may be too sensitive

## Final Recommendations
1. Verify the multiple peaks detection parameters
2. Consider adding more features to improve clustering
3. Use DBSCAN with optimized parameters for automated clustering
4. Maintain the special handling for saturated signals
5. Document the manual threshold approach clearly if it's to be used in production
